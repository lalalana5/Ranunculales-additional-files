## **Downloading the raw files from MassIVE**

In order to download a subset of files from MassIVE using command line, we have to create a text file with the names of files we want to download. The file used to download Ranunculales dataset can be downloaded from this repository and it is under the name "Ranunculales-IDs.txt".

Next, open the command prompt on your computer, navigate to the folder where the text file with IDâ€™s was saved using:

```
cd <path-to-the-folder>
```

Once you are in the same folder, run the following command after replacing file-with-IDs.txt with your text file's name.

```
for filename in $(cat file-with-IDs.txt); do wget ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000087728/raw/VGF_pos_with_QC_and_blanks_raw/$filename; done
```

Pressing the <Enter/Return> key will start the download of .raw files from MassIVE.
